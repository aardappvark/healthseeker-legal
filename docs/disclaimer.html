  <li>A substitute for professional medical, health, or fitness consultation</li>
  <li>Professional advice of any kind</li>

<h2>2. Not a Medical Device</h2>

<h2>4. Exercise Risk Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>By using HealthSeeker, you acknowledge that you understand and accept the following risks inherent in physical exercise:</p>

<h3>4.1 Cardiovascular risks</h3>
<p>Isometric exercises involve sustained muscle contraction, which can temporarily increase blood pressure. Individuals with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart conditions, or related health concerns should consult a physician before performing isometric exercises.</p>

<h3>4.2 Musculoskeletal injury</h3>
<p>Any exercise, including isometric holds, carries a risk of muscle strain, joint stress, tendon or ligament injury, or aggravation of pre-existing conditions. Proper form and technique are essential but are the sole responsibility of the user.</p>

<h3>4.3 Individual health conditions</h3>
<p>Certain medical conditions, medications, or physical limitations may make some exercises unsafe. The App cannot assess your individual health status or medical history. You are solely responsible for determining whether exercises are appropriate for your specific circumstances.</p>

<h3>4.4 Overexertion</h3>
<p>Following timer durations or workout routines without adequate rest, recovery, or consideration of your fitness level may lead to overexertion, fatigue, or injury. The App's default timer settings are general and may not be appropriate for all users.</p>

<h3>4.5 No guarantee of results</h3>
<p>HealthSeeker makes no guarantees, warranties, or promises regarding fitness results, strength gains, health improvements, or any other physical outcomes from using the App. Individual results vary based on numerous factors outside the App's control, including genetics, nutrition, sleep, existing fitness level, consistency, and overall health.</p>
