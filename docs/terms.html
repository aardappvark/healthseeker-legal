<div class="callout">
  <strong>HEALTH DISCLAIMER:</strong> HealthSeeker is not a medical device as defined by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or any equivalent regulatory authority. The App provides timer and tracking functionality only. It does not monitor vital signs, measure physical performance metrics via sensors, or provide personalised health recommendations. You should consult a qualified physician or healthcare provider before beginning any exercise programme.
</div>

<h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher) to use this App. By using the App, you represent and warrant that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are at least 18 years old or have reached the age of majority in your jurisdiction</li>
  <li>You are not located in, a resident of, or a national of any jurisdiction subject to comprehensive international sanctions (see our <a href="sanctions.html">Sanctions &amp; Restricted Regions Policy</a>)</li>

  <li>Your use of the App complies with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction</li>
  <li>You are physically fit to perform isometric exercises, or have obtained clearance from a qualified medical professional</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Health and Safety — Exercise at Your Own Risk</h2>
<div class="callout">
  <strong>CRITICAL DISCLAIMER:</strong> All exercise content, timer settings, routine suggestions, exercise tips, and workout tracking features provided by HealthSeeker are for general informational and convenience purposes only. None of this information constitutes medical advice, physiotherapy, personal training, or any other form of professional health or fitness advice.
</div>
<p>You expressly acknowledge, understand, and agree that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should consult a qualified physician or healthcare provider before beginning any exercise programme, including isometric exercises</li>
  <li>Isometric exercises involve sustained muscle contraction and may temporarily increase blood pressure — individuals with hypertension, cardiovascular conditions, or other health concerns should seek medical clearance</li>
  <li>The App provides timer and tracking tools only — it does not assess your physical condition, fitness level, or readiness to exercise</li>
  <li>You are solely responsible for determining appropriate exercise intensity, duration, and frequency for your individual health circumstances</li>
  <li>The developer is not a licensed physician, physiotherapist, personal trainer, exercise physiologist, or healthcare professional</li>
  <li>The App is not registered with or regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or any other health regulatory authority</li>
  <li>You assume all risk of injury, illness, or adverse health effects arising from your use of the App or performance of exercises</li>
  <li>You should stop exercising immediately and seek medical attention if you experience pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms</li>
  <li>Exercise tips and guidance provided in the App are general in nature and may not be suitable for your specific health conditions or fitness level</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Wallet Integration</h2>
<p>HealthSeeker uses Solana's Mobile Wallet Adapter (MWA) protocol for optional wallet sign-in. By connecting your wallet, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HealthSeeker communicates with your wallet app <strong>locally on your device</strong> — no data is sent to external servers during the sign-in process</li>
  <li>HealthSeeker receives only your wallet's <strong>public address</strong> and wallet app name</li>
  <li>HealthSeeker <strong>never</strong> has access to your private keys, seed phrases, mnemonic phrases, or wallet passwords</li>
  <li>HealthSeeker <strong>cannot</strong> initiate, sign, or execute any blockchain transactions</li>
  <li>Wallet connection is used for identification purposes only — the App does not display wallet balances or interact with blockchain data</li>
  <li>You are solely responsible for the security of your wallet, private keys, and all associated assets</li>
  <li>You may disconnect your wallet at any time via the App's Settings screen</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Seeker Genesis Token (SGT) Verification</h2>
<p>The App can check whether a connected wallet holds a Seeker Genesis Token. This feature:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is purely informational — it verifies on-chain token ownership status</li>
  <li>Makes no representation about the value, utility, investment potential, or future prospects of SGTs</li>
  <li>Relies on on-chain data which may have propagation delays or temporary inconsistencies</li>
  <li>Should not be relied upon as the sole method of verifying SGT ownership for any consequential purpose</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. No Token Distribution</h2>
<p>HealthSeeker does <strong>not</strong> distribute, mint, issue, sell, offer, or facilitate the acquisition of any cryptocurrency tokens, digital assets, reward points, or virtual currencies. The App is a workout timer and tracking tool with no token economics, no reward mechanisms, and no financial features beyond optional wallet identification.</p>
